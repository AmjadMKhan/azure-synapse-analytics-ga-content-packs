# The Integrated Machine Learning Process in Synapse Analytics

This lab demonstrates the integrated, end-to-end Azure Machine Learning experience in Azure Synapse Analytics. You will learn how to connect an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace to an Azure Machine Learning workspace using a Linked Service and then trigger an Automated ML experiment that uses data from a Spark table. You will also learn how to use the trained model to enrich data in a SQL pool table and then serve prediction results using Power BI.

After completing the lab, you will understand the main steps of an end-to-end Machine Learning process that build on top of the integration between Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Machine Learning.
